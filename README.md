# Responsive Portfolio

As a student, this homework is to create 3 webpages using Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. Bootstraps were used for navbar, grid system, responsive layout and responsive images.

* Bonus - used bootstrap for making a sticky footer and sub-columns and sub-rows.


## Installation

1. Download or clone repository
2. Open the main page (index.html) on your browser to view webpage
3. On the main page, you can click on the links on top right to go to the other 2 pages (portfolio.html and contact.html) or can open them up separately.
